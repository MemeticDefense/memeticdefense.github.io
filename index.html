  <h1>Rationale (or, What is This?)</h1>

  <p>
    I am not sure exactly yet what this is.
    (Maybe I will be able to delete this and the previous sentence soon.)
  </p>

  <p>
    I have found myself wondering how to find the shortest path to get someone what they need to know to understand
    enough biology, evolution, and memetics to make sense of the modern world.
    It is not clear to me if this document should be intended for children or for adults with no education on this
    topic.
    For this reason, I am not sure how to define the intended audience.
    What is the minimum age at which one can explain these concepts to children to inoculate them against memes?
    Maybe there should be multiple documents?
    Maybe the appropriate documents already exist and I am just not aware of them.

  <h1>Notes for Authors, Editors, and Collaborators</h1>

  <p>
    This document is developed as a single HTML file. The source is on GitHub at TK.
    Where possible,
    put individual sentences (and sometimes clauses) on individual lines to make it easier to understand contributions
    from collaborators.

  <p>
    This section might eventually go into a separate document in the same repository.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    We live in a world where memes are of increasing importance.
    Due to technological advances in communication,
    memes ripple through all of humanity faster than ever before.
    The speed at which memes travel and evolve is accelerating.
    Governments, religions, corporations, organizations are successfully leveraging memetics to manipulate humans to
    their ends.
    People are born into this world defenseless against these systems.
    This document attempts to give humans the shortest path to understanding memes and how to defend against them.

    The previous paragraph may not have made sense to you.
    If so, that is okay, keep reading.

<section id="howWeGotHere">

  <h1>How We Got Here</h1>

  <p>
    The Earth is 4.543 billion years old.
    Why is this important?
    This is important to realize because the processes which explain how we got here took enormous lengths of time
    during which only very small, iterative changes occurred.
    These spans of time are not easy for humans to comprehend, as they are many times longer than our normal
    experiences.
    This is also important because we are born into a world with some religions that require believing that the Earth is
    younger.
    This causes a problem for those who are trying to understand what we know of biology and evolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let us note something very important about the previous paragraph.
    We made a simple assertion, that the Earth is 4.543 billion years old.

  <h1>Unorganized</h1>

  <p>
    This section is where I am putting thoughts that I have not yet figured out how to organize.
  </p>

  <p>
    An important subtle point that is helpful for explaining our world and how we act:
    Humans are the mechanism by which genes replicate themselves.
    This is backwards from how people usually are taught to think about this.
    People are generally led or taught to think that genes are how humans and other organisms replicate themselves.
    This is also completely true,
    but the genes got here first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think about how many (most?) human cultures and legal systems are organized such that lineage matters.
    Why should we be expected to be kinder to our close relatives than to strangers?
    Why should my descendants inherit my wealth?
    Why do many people treat people with the same skin color better than people who look different?
    This is generally because genes have optimized the brain to identify those with more genes in common and help them
    procreate at the expense of competitors.
    We are hard-wired to be racist, to prefer that our descendants and kin get more of our resources.
    This makes perfect sense from the gene&apos;s perspective.
    This is why communists have such difficulty getting humans to share equally.
    It goes against millennia of evolution.
