        <span class="FIXME">This was originally a note from Gene. Revisit and reword.</span>
        I have found myself wondering how to find the shortest path to get someone what they need to know to understand
        enough biology, evolution, and memetics to make sense of the modern world.
        It is not clear to me if this document should be intended for children or for adults with no education on these
        topics.
        For this reason, I am not sure how to define the intended audience.
        What is the minimum age at which one can explain these concepts to children to inoculate them against memes?
        Maybe there should be multiple documents?
        Maybe the appropriate documents already exist and I am just not aware of them.
      </p>

      <p class="FIXME">
        Note from Gene: I immediately start using the word <code>meme</code> without defining it. I think this is a
        problem.
        In this document, I am using meme in the sense defined by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">The Selfish Gene</a>.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        We live in a world where memes are of increasing importance.
        Due to technological advances in communication,
        memes propagate through all of humanity faster than ever before.
        The speed at which memes travel and evolve is accelerating.
        Governments, religions, corporations, organizations are successfully leveraging memetics to manipulate humans to
        their ends.
        People are born into this world defenseless against these systems.
        By the time a human is old enough to understand memetics, he or she will have been subjected to and infected by
        many of them.
        Those using memes are getting better at it and now are even training computers to evolve memes to better
        manipulate people.
        People are swimming in marketing, propaganda, and influence campaigns, unaware of how these tools work, getting
        them to buy, believe, and do things that are not in their best interest.
        This document attempts to give humans the shortest path to understanding memes and how to defend against them.

      <h1>How We Got Here</h1>

      <p class="FIXME">
        This will need to be broken into subsections.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth">The Earth is 4.543 billion years old.</a>
        Why is this important?
        This is important to realize because the processes which explain how we got here took tiny, iterative changes
        over enormous spans of time.
        These spans of time are not easy for humans to comprehend, as they are many times longer than our normal
        experiences or even lifetimes.
        This is also important because we are born into a world with some religions that require believing that the
        Earth is younger.
        This causes a problem for those who are trying to understand what we know of biology and evolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let us pause here and note something very important about the previous paragraph.
        We made a simple assertion: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth">The Earth is 4.543 billion
        years old.</a>
        If this is the first time you have been exposed to this idea, you should not necessarily believe it.
        First, this is an approximation, based on what scientists have been able to test.
        Nobody knows for sure, but it would take many more words to caveat every such assertion with notations of
        accuracy and certainty, so we omit such phrasing.
        Importantly, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a> assertion.
        If someone finds an object on Earth (other than a meteoroid) that we can somehow determine to be older than
        4.543 billion years old, we will have to update our model.
        If we were to find a human-made artifact that is older than our current model of the age of humanity, we will
        have to update our model.
        Using a scientific model of the world means we have to be willing to discard it when it is disproven.
        This is a <span class="FIXME">(the?)</span> fundamental difference between religion and science.
        Note also that we made this assertion to be a hyperlink to the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> page about it.
        You should not blindly trust anything on Wikipedia.
        More importantly, you should not blindly believe anything in this document.
        You can follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth#References">references</a> cited in the
        Wikipedia article and find papers and articles that explain why this is widely accepted to be a good
        approximation for the age of the Earth.
        We will cite similar sources for every assertion we make.
        Approach this document with skepticism.
        When you read something in here, ask yourself if it is true, likely, or falsifiable.
        That is part of the purpose of this document, to make better skeptics, better defended against those using memes
        in ways that are not in their best interest.
        Note also that we explore very few topics in depth.
        You are encouraged to follow these links to learn more.

      <p>
        Some time after the Earth was formed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms">between
        4.28 and 3.77 billion years ago</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">life</a> appeared in the form
        of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)">replicating cell</a>.
        Most scientists think that life first occurred here on Earth through some form of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a>.
        (The theory that life originated elsewhere is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">panspermia</a>.
        Panspermia is considered to be a fringe theory.
        For our purposes, the origin of the first replicating cell is irrelevant.)
        The first replicating cell led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evolution is the result of replicating cells making imperfect copies of themselves.
        Some copies survive and replicate better than their ancestors.
        Some do not survive before replicating or fail to make copies of themselves.
        Those that make more copies of themselves pass along their genetic information better than those that do not.
        All natural environments have limitations which induce <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure">evolutionary pressure</a>, this results in a
        competition or race between organisms to continue improving relative to the constraints of their environment.
        Very slowly, over billions of years, organisms became more complicated.

      <h1>Unorganized</h1>

      <p>
        This section is where we are putting thoughts that we have not yet figured out how to organize.
      </p>

      <p>
        An important subtle point that is helpful for explaining our world and how we act:
        Humans are the mechanism by which genes replicate themselves.
        This is backwards from how people usually are taught to think about this.
        People are generally led or taught to think that genes are how humans and other organisms replicate themselves.
        This is also completely true,
        but the genes got here first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about how many (most?) human cultures and legal systems are organized such that lineage matters.
        Why should we be expected to be kinder to our close relatives than to strangers?
        Why should my descendants inherit my wealth?
        Why do many people treat people with the same skin color better than people who look different?
        This is generally because genes have optimized the brain to identify those with more genes in common and help
        them procreate at the expense of competitors.
        We are hard-wired to be racist, to prefer that our descendants and kin get more of our resources.
        This makes perfect sense from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution">gene&apos;s
        perspective</a>.
        This is why communists have such difficulty getting humans to share equally.
        It goes against millennia of evolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explain how organisms co-evolve (e.g., how plants and animals shape each other, how symbiotic organisms and
        parasites can shape other organisms).
      </p>

      <p>
        Not all memes are bad.
        Science is a meme.
        Memetics is a meme.
        A piece of clothing is a meme.
        &quot;smoking is good for you&quot; is a bad meme.
        Be deliberate about the memes you promote.
        Explain how people are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories, how they are propagating faster, evolving, used
        by state actors.
        Refer to the documented use by Russia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explain how emergent behavior between corporations uses memes that harm people.
        For example, encouraging people to buy more food and then to buy medication to counter diabetes.
        Shareholder win. Humans in general lose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Include a bestiary of powerful memes such as cigarette advertisements.
