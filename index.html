<h1 id="title">Memetics for Dummies</h1>

<p>
  An important subtle point that is helpful for explaining our world and how we act:
  Humans are the mechanism by which genes replicate themselves.
  This is backwards from how people usually are taught to think about this.
  People are generally led or taught to think that genes are how humans and other organisms replicate themselves.
  This is also completely true,
  but the genes got here first.

<p>
  Think about how many (most?) human cultures and legal systems are organized such that lineage matters.
  Why should we be expected to be kinder to our close relatives than to strangers?
  Why should my descendants inherit my wealth?
  Why do many people treat people with the same skin color better than people who look different?
  This is generally because genes have optimized the brain to perceive those with more genes in common to be more
  similar.
  We are hard-wired to be racist, to prefer that our descendants and kin get more of our resources.
  This makes perfect sense from the gene&apos;s perspective.
  This is why communists have such difficulty getting humans to share equally.
  It goes against millennia of evolution.
