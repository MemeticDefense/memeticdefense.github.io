      <h1>Rationale (or, What is This?)</h1>

      <p>
        I am not sure exactly yet what this is.
        (Maybe I will be able to delete this and the previous sentence soon.)
      </p>

      <p>
        I have found myself wondering how to find the shortest path to get someone what they need to know to understand
        enough biology, evolution, and memetics to make sense of the modern world.
        It is not clear to me if this document should be intended for children or for adults with no education on this
        topic.
        For this reason, I am not sure how to define the intended audience.
        What is the minimum age at which one can explain these concepts to children to inoculate them against memes?
        Maybe there should be multiple documents?
        Maybe the appropriate documents already exist and I am just not aware of them.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        We live in a world where memes are of increasing importance.
        Due to technological advances in communication,
        memes ripple through all of humanity faster than ever before.
        The speed at which memes travel and evolve is accelerating.
        Governments, religions, corporations, organizations are successfully leveraging memetics to manipulate humans to
        their ends.
        People are born into this world defenseless against these systems.
        Those using memes are getting better at it and now are even training computers to evolve memes to better
        manipulate people.
        People are swimming in marketing, propaganda, influence campaigns and unaware of how these tools work, getting
        them to buy things that are not in their best interest.
        This document attempts to give humans the shortest path to understanding memes and how to defend against them.

      <h1>How We Got Here</h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth">The Earth is 4.543 billion years old.</a>
        Why is this important?
        This is important to realize because the processes which explain how we got here took tiny, iterative changes
        over
        enormous spans of time.
        These spans of time are not easy for humans to comprehend, as they are many times longer than our normal
        experiences or even lifetimes.
        This is also important because we are born into a world with some religions that require believing that the
        Earth is
        younger.
        This causes a problem for those who are trying to understand what we know of biology and evolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let us pause here and note something very important about the previous paragraph.
        We made a simple assertion: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth">The Earth is 4.543 billion
        years
        old.</a>
        If this is the first time you have been exposed to this idea, you should not necessarily believe it.
        First, this is an approximation, based on what scientists have been able to test.
        Nobody knows for sure, but it would take many more words to caveat every such assertion with notations of
        accuracy
        and certainty.
        Importantly, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a> assertion.
        If someone finds an object on Earth (other than a meteoroid) that we can somehow determine to be older than
        4.543
        billion years old, we will have to update our model.
        If we were to find a human-made artifact that is older than our current model of the age of humanity, we will
        have
        to update our model.
        Using a scientific model of the world means we have to be willing to discard it when it is disproven.
        This is a (the?) fundamental difference between religion and science.
        Note also that we made this assertion to be a hyperlink to the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>
        page about it.
        You should not blindly trust anything on Wikipedia.
        More importantly, you should not blindly believe anything in this document.
        You can follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth#References">references</a> cited in the
        Wikipedia article and find papers and articles that explain why this is widely believed to be the age of the
        Earth.
        We will cite similar sources for every assertion we make.
        Approach this document with skepticism.
        When you read something in here, ask yourself if it is true.
        That is part of the purpose of this document, to make better skeptics, better defended against those using memes
        in ways that are not in their best interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, we have found no evidence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">life</a>a> anywhere else in
        the universe.
        (This is an amazing think to think about just on its own, given the enormous size of the observable universe.)
        There are two main theories on where life came from:
        Life either evolved right here on Earth from primitive molecules, or somehow made it to Earth from somewhere
        else.
        The theory that life originated elsewhere is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">Panspermia</a>.
        For our purposes, the understanding we need of genetics and how it shapes humans, it is irrelevant where life
        originated.
        No matter where the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)">replicating cell</a> came from,
        the outcome is the same: Evolution happened.

      <h1>Unorganized</h1>

      <p>
        This section is where I am putting thoughts that I have not yet figured out how to organize.
      </p>

      <p>
        An important subtle point that is helpful for explaining our world and how we act:
        Humans are the mechanism by which genes replicate themselves.
        This is backwards from how people usually are taught to think about this.
        People are generally led or taught to think that genes are how humans and other organisms replicate themselves.
        This is also completely true,
        but the genes got here first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about how many (most?) human cultures and legal systems are organized such that lineage matters.
        Why should we be expected to be kinder to our close relatives than to strangers?
        Why should my descendants inherit my wealth?
        Why do many people treat people with the same skin color better than people who look different?
        This is generally because genes have optimized the brain to identify those with more genes in common and help
        them
        procreate at the expense of competitors.
        We are hard-wired to be racist, to prefer that our descendants and kin get more of our resources.
        This makes perfect sense from the gene&apos;s perspective.
        This is why communists have such difficulty getting humans to share equally.
        It goes against millennia of evolution.
