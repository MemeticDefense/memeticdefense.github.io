  <h1>Rationale (or, What is This?)</h1>

  <p>
    I am not sure exactly yet what this is.
    (Maybe I will be able to delete this and the previous sentence soon.)

  <p>
    I have found myself wondering how to find the shortest path to get someone what they need to know to understand
    enough biology, evolution, and memetics to make sense of the modern world.
    It is not clear to me if this document should be intended for children or for adults with no education on this
    topic.
    For this reason, I am not sure how to define the intended audience.
    What is the minimum age at which one can explain these concepts to children to inoculate them against memes?
    Maybe there should be multiple documents?
    Maybe the appropriate documents already exist and I am just not aware of them.

  <h1>Unorganized</h1>

  <p>
    This section is where I am putting thoughts that I have not yet figured out how to organize.
  </p>

  <p>
    An important subtle point that is helpful for explaining our world and how we act:
    Humans are the mechanism by which genes replicate themselves.
    This is backwards from how people usually are taught to think about this.
    People are generally led or taught to think that genes are how humans and other organisms replicate themselves.
    This is also completely true,
    but the genes got here first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think about how many (most?) human cultures and legal systems are organized such that lineage matters.
    Why should we be expected to be kinder to our close relatives than to strangers?
    Why should my descendants inherit my wealth?
    Why do many people treat people with the same skin color better than people who look different?
    This is generally because genes have optimized the brain to perceive those with more genes in common to be more
    similar.
    We are hard-wired to be racist, to prefer that our descendants and kin get more of our resources.
    This makes perfect sense from the gene&apos;s perspective.
    This is why communists have such difficulty getting humans to share equally.
    It goes against millennia of evolution.
